==> general design:
* find a name for the final program
* Fix the database location problem
    --> use 'getEnv' and put the database in the home folder

==> testing:
* unit testing with quickcheck
* write tests scripts for stuff we can't unit test

==> search.hs:
* currently prints a newline on discarded entries, fix this.
