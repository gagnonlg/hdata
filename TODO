==> general design:
* find a solution to reuse the "Flags" datatype in different modules
    --> allow user to add with -b flag, adding the entry to the bookmarks from the start
    --> we will need to rethink how arguments are parsed
* find a name for the final program

==> Add.hs
* change the database Pages format to something better
    --> maybe 2 integer fields: page-from, page-to
    --> input format would be: -p <page1> [page2]

* rewrite getFlag and getValues so that getValues doesn't use 'error'

==> testing:
* unit testing with quickcheck
* write tests scripts for stuff we can't unit test

==> build system:
* investigate change from Makefile to usual haskell build system
