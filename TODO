==> general design:
* find a name for the final program

==> Add.hs
* change the database Pages format to something better
    --> maybe 2 integer fields: page-from, page-to
    --> input format would be: -p <page1> [page2]

==> testing:
* unit testing with quickcheck
* write tests scripts for stuff we can't unit test
