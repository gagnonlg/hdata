==> general:
* find a solution to reuse the "Flags" datatype in different modules
    --> allow user to add with -b flag, adding the entry to the bookmarks from the start

==> Add.hs
* change the database Pages format to something better
    --> maybe 2 integer fields: page-from, page-to
    --> input format would be: -p <page1> [page2]

* rewrite getFlag and getValues so that getValues doesn't use 'error'
